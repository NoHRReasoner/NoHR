A Query Tool for EL with Non-monotonic rules
=============
We present a Prote ́ge ́ plug-in that allows the user to take an EL+⊥ ontology, add a set of non-monotonic (logic programming) rules – suitable e.g. to express defaults and exceptions – and query the combined knowledge base. Our approach uses the well-founded semantics for MKNF knowledge bases as underlying formalism, so no restriction other than DL-safety is imposed on the rules that can be written. The tool itself builds on the procedure SLG(O) and, with the help of OWL 2 EL reasoner ELK, pre-processes the ontology into rules, whose result together with the non-monotonic rules serve as input for the top- down querying engine XSB Prolog. With the resulting plug-in, even queries to very large ontologies, such as SNOMED CT, augmented with a large number of rules, can be processed at an interactive response time after one initial brief pre- processing period. At the same time, our system admits leveraging the capabilities of XSB to explain reasoning results and using its additional language constructs.
